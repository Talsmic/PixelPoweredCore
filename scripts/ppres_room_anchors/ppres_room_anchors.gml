/*=[Notes]======================================================================
	-	These anchors are useful for rooms where you want to expand the 
		resolution around a certain point, say the action happens in the middle 
		of the room	and as resolution increases you just want to increase the 
		view around that area.	
	-	Edit this script to add anchors for any rooms you need to, an example is 
		provided with rm_PPCPlayground.
	-	Comment out or delete the rm_PPCPlayground reference if you delete it.
