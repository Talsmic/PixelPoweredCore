=[ Forward (What is the PPC?) ]=================================================
	
	The PixelPoweredCore, or simply PPC for short, is a collection of additional
	GML (GameMakerLanguage) functions, objects and tools designed to be easily
	imported into a project (normal a fresh project) to expand the functionality 
	you have quick and easy access to in GameMaker Studio 2.
	
	A lot of the functions here are designed for use with pixel art style games
	and has a strong focus on elements that make designing user interfaces for 
	these games really easy, as well as important things like scaling pixel 
	perfect resolution management.
	
	I've done my best to document the included things to a useful degree, feel
	free to alter, edit, add to or remove whatever you want.

=[ Where to start ]=============================================================
	
	I've included a detailed start guide that runs you through setting up 
	certain elements and it's a worthwhile read that may highlight some included
	functionality you're not aware of.
	See Link: PPCDoc_DetailedStartGuide();
	
	Otherwise, the individual function guides should detail what you need to 
	know on most elements, and you probably installed this addon for something 
	specific, so either find the fuction, or check out the documentation index 
	for the links.
	
	As long as nothing you've already made causes clashes, and you've added 
	everything, any set up steps for the PPC are optional, it shouldn't break a 
	project and you should be able to compile as normal without issues.
	
	It's worth noting if you're not aware, while editing any code, highlighting 
	a function not core to GameMaker Studio and pressing [F1] will open that
	fuction. I've scattered links back to documentation in most functions so
	you can quickly open them at any time.
	
=[ What/Who is the PPC For? ]===================================================
	
	The PPC is mostly for my personal use, allowing me to quickly prototype new 
	ideas quickly and easily at a decent visual quality, but I intend to one day
	release it to help other people learn as I have learned, or simply have 
	access to a decent library of common (and less common) tricks.
	
=[ Who made this? ]=============================================================
	
	I'm just an average Australian dude. I have no formal coding training, I
	simply taught myself while writing and refining these functions. That means
	some stuff might be a little wonky, outside the box or off-standard. 
	
	If you need to contact me, shoot an email to [talsmic@gmail.com]. 
	I'll respond to anything, in my own time, as long as you're polite.
	I'm happy to help in any way you might need.

=[ It broke! What do? ]=========================================================
	
	Read the pages On Dependancies and On Inputs and Outputs. Most issues basic 
	issues can be solved by understanding these concepts and/or following the
	troubleshooting steps given.
		On Dependancies:		PPCDoc_OnDependancies()
		On Inputs and Outputs:	PPCDoc_OnInputsAndOutputs()
	
	For anything advanced or that isn't solved by those two pages:
