=[ A Note on Inputs and Outputs ]===============================================
	
	Inputs are the arguments you give the PPC functions (everything in the 
	brackets after a script name) to get them to do what you want.
	Outputs are anything those functions return for you.
	
		1.	[WIP]

=[ If / When Stuff Breaks ]=====================================================

	Despite best intentions, stuff goes wrong, and if you're not editting the 
	scripts (and still often if you are), 9/10 times that means it's either a 
	an input issue, an output issue or a dependancy issue. 
							(read more on Dependancies: PPCDoc_OnDependancies())
	
		-	[WIP]
			
		-	If you've checked your dependancies, inputs and outputs and you're 
			still getting issues, ask for help by posting on the Marketplace 
			page or emailing me at talsmic@gmail.com (feel free to do both).
			
		-	If it was all working well but then you updated either the PPC 
			package	or GameMaker and that started the issues, try reverting to
			an older version of the package or the GameMaker runtime.
			If this fixes it, I must stress, still contact me to tell me! It 
			means is I broke something or GameMaker changed something that 
			broke my code. I'll fix it, but I have to know.
